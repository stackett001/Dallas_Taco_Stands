		<h1>Taco Tour Around Dallas</h1>
		<h2>If you're new to Dallas, checkout Big D one taco at a time!</h2>

			<h3 class="tacomeat"> Torchy's Tacos </h3>
				<p> Torchy's has everything that you want in a taco with a laid back flair.  My personal favorite is the Trailer Park Trashy on flour, but I'm always tempted to try the taco of the month. Be prepared for their super spicy diablo sauce.</p>

			<h3 class="tacomeat"> Blue Mesa </h3>
				<p> Moving both east and south of the Preston Hollow Torchy's location, you will find all things Southwestern at Blue Mesa.  Located near North Park Mall, Blue Mesa removes the Tex out of tacos and adds a little South By Southwest in a taco kind of way!</p>

			<h3 class="tacomeat"> Velvet Taco </h3>
				<p> Moving along I-75 South, you will notice Velvet Taco as you approach the M Streets area.  You guessed it!  This Dallas neighborhood is made up of street names that mostly begin with an 'M'.  Velvet Taco takes quite a bit of liberty with the untraditional taco.  Best known for their chicken and waffle taco, these tacos are worthy of a visit.</p>
